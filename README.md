## Repository Content
This repository includes the following resources:

### Datasets

1. **`search1.xlsx`**:  
   - **Number of publications**: 1526.  
   - **Description**: Identifies titles (TI) or keywords (AK) containing the terms _‘collision avoidance’_ or _‘collision-free’_ combined with _‘robot’_. Excludes mobility-related terms such as _‘mobile robots’_, _‘autonomous’_, among others.

2. **`search2.xlsx`**:  
   - **Number of publications**: 291.  
   - **Description**: Based on the criteria of search 1, terms such as _‘pick place’_, _‘manipulator’_, _‘arm’_ are added in the titles or keywords, together with _‘collision avoidance’_ or _‘collision-free’_. Exclusions related to mobility are maintained.

3. **`search3.xlsx`**:  
   - **Number of publications**: 237.  
   - **Description**: The criteria of search 2 are maintained, but an additional filter is added to restrict the results to specific areas such as **Engineering, Robotics, Computer Science or Automatic Control Systems**.

4. **`search4.xlsx`**:  
   - **Number of publications**: 169.
